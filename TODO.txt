- Set up project structure
- Set up cake build script
- Set up Azure pipelines
- Complete CmdtyStorage class and builder

Later
- Sort out build coverage
- Creation of NuGet package

By End of Thursday 15-Aug-2019
- Intrinsic storage valuation
- Good code coverage
- Tidy up to do list
- NuGet package published
- PyPI package published

Essential
- Sort out discounting
- Unit tests for polynomial inject/withdraw constraint
- Update grid spacing to be function of CmdtyStorage and inventory constraints
- Valuation result contains decisions grid
	- Methods for outputting these as CSV files
- Value on day before end date + unit test (storage has inventory some inventory which gets withdrawn)
- Unit test inventory checking
	- Do checks on expiry date too
- Unit test decision generation when min and max inject/withdraw constraints are equal

Nice to Have
- Use parallel loop in backward induction
- Ability to have more than 3 decision?
- Flag for whether decision has been made in current period

- Valuation results include trigger prices for inject and withdraw?
