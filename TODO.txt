- Set up project structure
- Set up cake build script
- Set up Azure pipelines
- Complete CmdtyStorage class and builder

Later
- Sort out build coverage
- Creation of NuGet package

By End of Thursday 15-Aug-2019
- Intrinsic storage valuation
- Good code coverage
- Tidy up to do list
- NuGet package published
- PyPI package published

Essential
- Sort out discounting
- Change order in fluent storage builder api of min and max inventory constraints
- Unit tests with non-zero value
	- Value on day before end date + unit test (storage has inventory some inventory which gets withdrawn)
		- Test with inventory varying inject/withdraw

- Update grid spacing to be function of CmdtyStorage and inventory constraints
	- Default is evenly spaced based on global max minus min inventory
- Valuation result contains decisions grid
	- Methods for outputting these as CSV files
- Unit test decision generation when min and max inject/withdraw constraints are equal
- Unit test inventory checking
	- Do checks on expiry date too
- Check that withdrawal rate doesn't decrease with inventory, and injection rate doesn't increase with inventory
	- Just causes root finding to fail?
- Extension methods for creating storage
	- Time and inventory varying inject/withdraw constraints
		- Calling code can specify piecewise table
	- Inventory range of inject/withdraw constraints also specifies inventory constraint of storage?
	- Time varying min and max inventory
		- Make parameter TimeSeries type?

Nice to Have
- Use parallel loop in backward induction
- Ability to have more than 3 decision?
- Flag for whether decision has been made in current period

- Valuation results include trigger prices for inject and withdraw?
